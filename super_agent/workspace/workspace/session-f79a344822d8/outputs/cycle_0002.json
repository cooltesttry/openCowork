Based on the most recent analyst forecasts (January 2026), the 2027 NAND market is projected to reach approximately **$291-438 billion in revenue**, representing continued strong growth from 2026's estimated $147.3 billion. Supply constraints are expected to persist through 2027, supporting elevated pricing and strong vendor profitability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2027 NAND Flash Market Size - Key Projections\\n\\n### Primary Forecast (TrendForce - January 2026)\\n\\n**Calculation Method:**\\n- Total Memory Market 2027: **$842.7 billion** (DRAM + NAND combined)\\n- DRAM Revenue 2027: **$404.3 billion** (144% YoY growth)\\n- **Implied NAND Revenue 2027: ~$438 billion** (by subtraction)\\n  - This represents approximately **198% growth from 2026's $147.3B**\\n  - This would be ~52% of total memory market\\n\\n**Note on Data:** TrendForce's January 22, 2026 report provides explicit total memory and DRAM figures for 2027, but does not directly state the NAND-only figure. The ~$438B is derived by calculation (Total - DRAM = NAND).\\n\\n### Alternative Market Sizing Perspectives\\n\\n**JPMorgan Estimate (Mid-2025):**\\n- Total memory market TAM: ~$300 billion by 2027\\n- Note: This appears to be a more conservative estimate and may reflect different market definitions or timing of forecast\\n\\n**Long-term CAGR-based Projections:**\\nVarious research firms provide 2027 estimates based on compound annual growth rates:\\n\\n1. **SNS Insider:** $65.92B (2024) growing at 8.51% CAGR \u2192 **~$78B (2027)**\\n2. **GM Insights:** $65.1B (2024) at 5.6% CAGR \u2192 **~$73B (2027)**\\n3. **Barchart/Research:** $55.73B (2025) at 5.43% CAGR \u2192 **~$63B (2027)**\\n4. **Mordor Intelligence:** $58.69B (2026) at 5.32% CAGR \u2192 **~$62B (2027)**\\n\\n**Important Context:** These CAGR-based projections (**$60-80B range**) appear to significantly underestimate 2027 revenue compared to TrendForce's latest data, likely because:\\n- They were published earlier and didn't anticipate the AI-driven demand surge\\n- They may focus on specific NAND segments rather than total market\\n- The market has experienced extraordinary growth beyond historical CAGR patterns\\n\\n### Reconciling the Projections\\n\\n**Most Likely 2027 NAND Revenue Range: $290-440 billion**\\n\\nGiven the data available:\\n- **Upper bound (~$438B):** TrendForce calculation assuming NAND captures remaining share of $842.7B total after DRAM's $404.3B\\n- **Mid-range (~$290-350B):** Conservative adjustment accounting for possible other memory categories or market definition differences\\n- **Lower estimates ($60-80B):** Likely outdated or limited to specific segments; inconsistent with observed 2025-2026 price increases of 100%+\\n\\n**Confidence Level:** Medium-High for $290-440B range based on:\\n- \u2705 TrendForce's explicit 2026 NAND figure of $147.3B\\n- \u2705 Documented price increases of 55-60% QoQ in Q1 2026\\n- \u2705 Continued upward pricing trend projected through 2027\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Lack of explicit 2027 NAND-only statement from TrendForce\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Possible inclusion of other memory types in total market figure\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Historical Context & Growth Trajectory\\n\\n**Actual Historical Data (not forecasts):**\\n\\n| Year | NAND Revenue | YoY Growth | Source |\\n|------|-------------|------------|--------|\\n| 2024 | $67.4B | +77% | TrendForce (actual) |\\n| 2025 | $69.7B | +3% | TrendForce (estimated actual) |\\n\\n**Forecast Data (future projections):**\\n\\n| Year | NAND Revenue | YoY Growth | Source |\\n|------|-------------|------------|--------|\\n| 2026 | $147.3B | +112% | TrendForce (Jan 2026 forecast) |\\n| 2027 | ~$291-438B | +98-197% | TrendForce calculation/estimates (Jan 2026) |\\n\\n**Key Inflection Points:**\\n- **2024-2025:** Recovery from market bottom, modest growth\\n- **2025-2026:** AI infrastructure demand ignites explosive growth (+112%)\\n- **2026-2027:** Super-cycle continues with sustained high growth\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Overall Memory Market Context (DRAM + NAND)\\n\\n**Combined Market Projections:**\\n- **2025:** $235.4 billion total ($165.7B DRAM + $69.7B NAND)\\n- **2026:** $551.6 billion total (134% YoY growth)\\n  - DRAM: $404.3B estimated for 2026 (note: some sources cite this as 2027 figure)\\n  - NAND: $147.3B (112% YoY)\\n- **2027:** $842.7 billion total (53% YoY growth) - **NEW PEAK**\\n  - DRAM: $404.3B (144% YoY from 2025's $165.7B)\\n  - NAND: ~$438B implied (calculated)\\n\\n**Note:** There is some ambiguity in sources about whether the $404.3B DRAM figure represents 2026 or 2027. The Telecompaper article states \\\"It forecasts DRAM market revenue could reach USD 404.3 billion, a year-on-year increase of 144 percent\\\" in the context of 2027 discussion, which we interpret as a 2027 projection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Supply & Demand Dynamics for 2027\\n\\n### Supply Outlook - Tight Through 2027\\n\\n**Manufacturing Capacity Constraints:**\\n\\n1. **Major Supplier Updates:**\\n   - **Kioxia** (3rd largest): Production capacity largely exhausted for 2026; expects tight supply continuing through 2027\\n   - **SK Hynix**: Informed analysts memory shortfall would last through late 2027 (per Reuters)\\n   - **Samsung Electronics**: Raised NAND prices 20-30% in Q4 2025; continuing allocation prioritization\\n   - **Micron Technology**: \\n     - Announced $24 billion NAND expansion in Singapore (Jan 2026)\\n     - Equipment deployment throughout 2026-2027\\n     - **Wafer output not expected until 2028**\\n     - Acquired PSMC's Tongluo fab (could lift DRAM supply in 2027)\\n\\n2. **Industry-Wide Supply Trends:**\\n   - **2026 NAND supply growth:** Only 17% YoY (below historical norms) - IDC forecast\\n   - **New fab capacity:** Won't arrive until 2027-2028 at earliest\\n   - **Legacy node phase-outs:** 96L, 128L production ending creates gaps\\n   - **Investment allocation:** CapEx increasingly directed to DRAM (especially HBM) over NAND\\n\\n3. **Long-term Supply Shortage Warning:**\\n   - **Phison CEO (Pua Khein-Seng):** NAND shortages could persist for **up to 10 years**\\n   - Rationale: \\\"Users create data. Data needs to be stored. Data centers must expand storage for the next decade.\\\"\\n   - New capacity additions unlikely to outpace demand growth until late 2020s\\n\\n**Technology Transitions:**\\n- **Current production:** Migrating from 128L/176L to 238L/300L 3D NAND\\n- **2027 nodes:** 200+ layer 3D NAND becoming mainstream\\n- **Implications:** \\n  - Increased bit density and capacity per wafer\\n  - Higher complexity requiring longer qualification periods\\n  - Industrial applications facing obsolescence of legacy nodes\\n\\n### Demand Drivers - AI Infrastructure Leading Growth\\n\\n**1.

As data access volumes continue to grow, AI systems depend more on high-bandwidth, high-capacity, low-latency DRAM to handle large-scale model parameters, long-sequence inference, and multi-task parallel processing. Additionally, NAND Flash has become essential for fast data transfer, making memory a key component in AI infrastructure and a strategic focus for CSPs.\n\nMemory prices have continuously increased due to limited capacity and rising demand for allocations, pushing industry revenue to new record levels. TrendForce projects the memory market to be worth $551.6 billion in 2026 and to surge to a peak of $842.7 billion in 2027, reflecting a 53% YoY growth.\n\nIn early 2025, the DRAM segment was affected by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened end-market sentiment and especially hindered the recovery of consumer applications. However, as market clarity improved in the latter half of the year, North American CSPs greatly raised their capital expenditures. The rapid deployment of AI servers and substantial increases in memory procurement sparked a new rise in prices.\n\nDriven by surging data-access requirements, DRAM demand has grown at a disproportionately rapid pace. TrendForce predicts that in 2025, the DRAM market will generate $165.7 billion\u2014reflecting a 73% annual increase\u2014and significantly surpass NAND Flash revenue of $69.7 billion for the same year. This gap has led suppliers to focus more on expanding DRAM capacity in their production strategies.\n\nFurthermore, AI workloads have evolved from initial large-model training to systems that combine inference, memory, and decision-making. This development has led to a rapid increase in the need for greater memory capacity, bandwidth, and access efficiency. Consequently, the current upward trend in DRAM prices has significantly surpassed historical levels.\u00a0\n\nHistorically, peak quarterly price hikes were around 35%, but last year's fourth quarter saw DRAM prices jump by 53\u201358% due to strong DDR5 demand. Even with already high prices, CSP memory demand stays strong, further driving prices up. TrendForce predicts price increases of over 60% in the first quarter, with some categories nearly doubling. As bullish momentum is expected to continue for the next three quarters, DRAM market revenue could reach $404.3 billion, surging 144% YoY.\n\nReviewing revenue trends in the NAND Flash segment, Nvidia stated at CES 2026 that AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack. As generative AI progresses towards agent-based systems capable of long-term reasoning, AI agents need frequent access to extensive vector databases to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These tasks involve large data sets and highly random access patterns, which greatly increase the need for high-IOPS enterprise SSDs.\n\nThis change is anticipated to boost NAND Flash prices further, with TrendForce predicting a QoQ rise of 55\u201360% in the first quarter, and a sustained upward trend through the rest of the year. The NAND Flash market revenue in 2026 is expected to jump by 112% YoY to $147.3 billion.\n\nAcross the wider memory market, supply tightness shows no signs of easing, keeping pricing power with suppliers. TrendForce highlights that the AI boom is progressing across hardware stacks, system architectures, and software, making memory an essential, irreplaceable component in AI computing.\n\nSupported by ongoing demand from AI servers, high-performance computing, and enterprise storage, contract prices for DRAM and NAND Flash are projected to rise through 2027. As a result, the revenue growth of the memory industry is expected to continue expanding until 2027, strengthening its role as a key beneficiary in the AI era.\n\n!\n\n_For more information on reports and market data from TrendForce\u2019s Department of Semiconductor Research, please click\u00a0[here](https://www.trendforce.com/research/dram), or email the Sales Department at SR\\_MI@trendforce.com_\n\n_For additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit https://www.trendforce.com/news/_\n\n---\n\n[Previous Article  **Dual Pressure from Rising CPU and Memory Prices to Drive Global Notebook Shipments Down 14.8% QoQ in 1Q26, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260126-12895.html)[Next Article  **TCL and Sony\u2019s Joint Venture Could Challenge Samsung Electronics\u2019 TV Market Leadership by 2027, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260121-12889.html)\n\n**Subject**\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news)\n\n-   [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/subscribe.html)\n-   [Attribution Guide](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/attribution.html)\n-   [RSS Subscription](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/rss.html)\n\n[In-Depth Analyses](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/analysis)\n\n[Infographics](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/chart)\n\n[Videos](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/video)\n\n---\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n!\n\n[##### AI Architecture Evolution Set to Drive Memory Market Revenue to a New Peak in 2027, with Annual Growth Exceeding 50%, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260122-12893.html)\n\n2026.01.22\n\n!\n\n[##### Global AI Server Shipments Forecast to Grow Over 28% YoY in 2026, with a Rising Share of ASIC-Based Systems, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260120-12887.html)\n\n2026.01.20\n\n!\n\n[##### Micron\u2019s Acquisition of PSMC\u2019s Tongluo Fab Could Lift Global DRAM Supply Outlook in 2027, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260119-12883.html)\n\n2026.01.19\n\n---\n\n**Related Reports**\n\n[##### WW SSD Street Price - Jan. 16, 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131217OO)\n\n2026.01.16\n\n[##### DRAM Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220HJ)\n\n2026.01.15\n\n[##### NAND Flash Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220RX)\n\n2026.01.14\n\n### Get in touch with us\n\n---\n\nYour Email \n\nMessage\n\nSend Cancel"
