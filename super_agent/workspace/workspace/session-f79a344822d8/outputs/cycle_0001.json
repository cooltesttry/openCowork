As data access volumes continue to grow, AI systems depend more on high-bandwidth, high-capacity, low-latency DRAM to handle large-scale model parameters, long-sequence inference, and multi-task parallel processing. Additionally, NAND Flash has become essential for fast data transfer, making memory a key component in AI infrastructure and a strategic focus for CSPs.\n\nMemory prices have continuously increased due to limited capacity and rising demand for allocations, pushing industry revenue to new record levels. TrendForce projects the memory market to be worth $551.6 billion in 2026 and to surge to a peak of $842.7 billion in 2027, reflecting a 53% YoY growth.\n\nIn early 2025, the DRAM segment was affected by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened end-market sentiment and especially hindered the recovery of consumer applications. However, as market clarity improved in the latter half of the year, North American CSPs greatly raised their capital expenditures. The rapid deployment of AI servers and substantial increases in memory procurement sparked a new rise in prices.\n\nDriven by surging data-access requirements, DRAM demand has grown at a disproportionately rapid pace. TrendForce predicts that in 2025, the DRAM market will generate $165.7 billion\u2014reflecting a 73% annual increase\u2014and significantly surpass NAND Flash revenue of $69.7 billion for the same year. This gap has led suppliers to focus more on expanding DRAM capacity in their production strategies.\n\nFurthermore, AI workloads have evolved from initial large-model training to systems that combine inference, memory, and decision-making. This development has led to a rapid increase in the need for greater memory capacity, bandwidth, and access efficiency. Consequently, the current upward trend in DRAM prices has significantly surpassed historical levels.\u00a0\n\nHistorically, peak quarterly price hikes were around 35%, but last year's fourth quarter saw DRAM prices jump by 53\u201358% due to strong DDR5 demand. Even with already high prices, CSP memory demand stays strong, further driving prices up. TrendForce predicts price increases of over 60% in the first quarter, with some categories nearly doubling. As bullish momentum is expected to continue for the next three quarters, DRAM market revenue could reach $404.3 billion, surging 144% YoY.\n\nReviewing revenue trends in the NAND Flash segment, Nvidia stated at CES 2026 that AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack. As generative AI progresses towards agent-based systems capable of long-term reasoning, AI agents need frequent access to extensive vector databases to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These tasks involve large data sets and highly random access patterns, which greatly increase the need for high-IOPS enterprise SSDs.\n\nThis change is anticipated to boost NAND Flash prices further, with TrendForce predicting a QoQ rise of 55\u201360% in the first quarter, and a sustained upward trend through the rest of the year. The NAND Flash market revenue in 2026 is expected to jump by 112% YoY to $147.3 billion.\n\nAcross the wider memory market, supply tightness shows no signs of easing, keeping pricing power with suppliers. TrendForce highlights that the AI boom is progressing across hardware stacks, system architectures, and software, making memory an essential, irreplaceable component in AI computing.\n\nSupported by ongoing demand from AI servers, high-performance computing, and enterprise storage, contract prices for DRAM and NAND Flash are projected to rise through 2027. As a result, the revenue growth of the memory industry is expected to continue expanding until 2027, strengthening its role as a key beneficiary in the AI era.\n\n!\n\n_For more information on reports and market data from TrendForce\u2019s Department of Semiconductor Research, please click\u00a0[here](https://www.trendforce.com/research/dram), or email the Sales Department at SR\\_MI@trendforce.com_\n\n_For additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit https://www.trendforce.com/news/_\n\n---\n\n[Previous Article  **Dual Pressure from Rising CPU and Memory Prices to Drive Global Notebook Shipments Down 14.8% QoQ in 1Q26, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260126-12895.html)[Next Article  **TCL and Sony\u2019s Joint Venture Could Challenge Samsung Electronics\u2019 TV Market Leadership by 2027, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260121-12889.html)\n\n**Subject**\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news)\n\n-   [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/subscribe.html)\n-   [Attribution Guide](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/attribution.html)\n-   [RSS Subscription](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/rss.html)\n\n[In-Depth Analyses](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/analysis)\n\n[Infographics](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/chart)\n\n[Videos](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/video)\n\n---\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n!\n\n[##### AI Architecture Evolution Set to Drive Memory Market Revenue to a New Peak in 2027, with Annual Growth Exceeding 50%, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260122-12893.html)\n\n2026.01.22\n\n!\n\n[##### Global AI Server Shipments Forecast to Grow Over 28% YoY in 2026, with a Rising Share of ASIC-Based Systems, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260120-12887.html)\n\n2026.01.20\n\n!\n\n[##### Micron\u2019s Acquisition of PSMC\u2019s Tongluo Fab Could Lift Global DRAM Supply Outlook in 2027, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260119-12883.html)\n\n2026.01.19\n\n---\n\n**Related Reports**\n\n[##### WW SSD Street Price - Jan. 16, 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131217OO)\n\n2026.01.16\n\n[##### DRAM Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220HJ)\n\n2026.01.15\n\n[##### NAND Flash Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220RX)\n\n2026.01.14\n\n### Get in touch with us\n\n---\n\nYour Email \n\nMessage\n\nSend Cancel"

But as the **NAND flash memory market** enters a new super-cycle, that approach is no longer sustainable.\n\nJust as SSDs replaced spinning disks to deliver higher performance and reliability, the **NAND ecosystem** itself is now transforming \u2014 reshaping **availability, pricing, lead-times, and technology roadmaps**.\n\nIndustrial customers, in particular, must begin **forecasting NAND requirements through 2027 and beyond** to avoid cost and supply shocks.\n\n**1\\. The NAND Demand Landscape Has Shifted**\n\n**AI, Data Centers, and the Data Explosion**\n\nThe NAND market\u2019s center of gravity has shifted dramatically.\n\nWhere demand once came primarily from smartphones, PCs, and enterprise SSDs, the new growth engines are **AI infrastructure** and **hyperscale data centers**.\n\nAccording to **Phison Electronics CEO Pua Khein-Seng**, **NAND shortages could begin in 2026 and last up to a decade**. He puts it simply:\n\n\u201cUsers create data. Data needs to be stored. Which means data centers must expand storage for the next decade.\u201d \u00a0[tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-ceo-claims-nand-shortage-could-last-a-staggering-10-years-says-memory-supercycle-imminent-and-severe-2026-shortages-are-at-hand)\n\nAs AI and edge applications scale, industrial NAND module and card buyers will increasingly **compete with data centers and hyperscalers** for limited NAND capacity.\n\n**Supply Constraints and Investment Shifts**\n\nMeanwhile, on the supply side, many NAND manufacturers have **cut capital expenditures** following years of overproduction. Around 2023, much of the semiconductor investment pivoted toward **high-bandwidth memory (HBM)** and AI-centric architectures instead of expanding NAND capacity.\n\nThis has created a **supply gap** just as demand accelerates.\n\nRecent market data backs it up:\n\n-   In **October 2025**, NAND wafer contract prices jumped sharply, with **spot and contract NAND prices up 10\u201315%** (TrendForce.com).\n-   Major suppliers like **Samsung** and **SK Hynix** raised NAND and DRAM pricing by up to **30%** in Q4 2025.\n\nThe stage is set for a sustained **memory super-cycle** \u2014 one that will affect industrial NAND buyers most directly.\n\n**2\\. How the NAND Super-Cycle Impacts Industrial Applications**\n\n**Longer Life Cycles, Shorter Supply Windows**\n\nIndustrial and embedded applications \u2014 from automation and networking to transportation and defense \u2014 often have **5\u201310-year product life cycles**. NAND technology, however, evolves every 12\u201318 months.\n\nWhen NAND nodes transition (for example, from 128-layer to 238-layer 3D NAND), older die is phased out and sourcing them becomes harder or more expensive. Without long-term supply planning, this can force **unexpected redesigns**, **qualification delays**, or even **product discontinuation**.\n\n**Smaller Volumes, Lower Priority**\n\nIn times of shortage, NAND fabs prioritize **large-volume buyers** like consumer electronics and hyperscale SSD customers. Industrial NAND suppliers, who operate at smaller scale, may find themselves **further down the allocation queue**.\n\nThat\u2019s why **forecasting 18\u201324 months ahead** \u2014 and securing firm allocation commitments \u2014 is now essential.\n\n**Price Volatility and BOM Pressure**\n\nAs NAND prices rise, module and card suppliers face difficult choices: absorb higher costs or pass them on. For OEMs with fixed pricing or long-term contracts, this can hit margins hard.\n\nBuilding **cost buffers** and **index-based pricing mechanisms** into your supplier agreements can prevent margin erosion.\n\n**Technology Transitions and Qualification Challenges**\n\nNAND manufacturers are migrating to higher-layer stacks like **238L and 300L 3D NAND**, improving capacity and performance but increasing **qualification complexity**.\n\nIndustrial NAND modules and cards must undergo **rigorous testing and firmware optimization** each time die technology changes. Without visibility into supplier roadmaps, these transitions can disrupt project schedules.\n\n**The Risks of Spot-Buying**\n\nThe days of opportunistic NAND procurement are over. In a tightening market, **spot-buying** often means paying premiums \u2014 or finding no supply at all.\n\nInstead, industrial customers need a **forecast-driven procurement model** built around long-term agreements and buffer inventory.\n\n**3\\. Reading the Market Signals**\n\nThe NAND market is already flashing red:\n\n-   **Contract NAND flash wafer prices** rose sharply in October 2025 due to strong AI and enterprise SSD demand. [Trendforce.com](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP251031MX)\n-   **Spot prices** climbed 10\u201315% in major regions, while **Samsung** and **SK Hynix** pushed memory prices 20\u201330% higher. [Trendforce.com](https://www.trendforce.com/price/flash/flash_spot)\n-   **Inventory levels** in the global supply chain are near historic lows. [Oscoo.com](https://www.oscoo.com/news/nand-flash-may-face-a-decade-long-shortage/)\n-   **Manufacturers are prioritizing HBM and next-gen 3D NAND**, diverting resources away from legacy nodes. [Trendforce.com](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/23/news-samsung-sk-hynix-reportedly-lift-memory-prices-up-to-30-long-term-supply-deals-in-play/)\n\nThese indicators point to a prolonged **tight-supply environment**, not a temporary price spike.\n\n**4\\. A Roadmap for Industrial NAND Procurement (2025\u20132027)**\n\nTo navigate the next NAND cycle, industrial customers should focus on five key strategies.\n\n**A. Forecast NAND Needs 24\u201336 Months Out**\n\nMap your expected consumption:\n\n-   How many modules or cards will you need over the next 2\u20133 years?\n-   What densities (GB/TB) will each design require?\n-   What new products or refreshes are on the horizon?\n\nShare this data with your NAND module supplier early \u2014 it helps them **secure upstream NAND allocations** before shortages hit.\n\n**B. Lock In Long-Term Supply Agreements**\n\nAvoid relying on the open market. Instead:\n\n-   Sign **multi-year supply contracts** with fixed or indexed pricing\n-   Reserve **allocation or safety stock** for critical products\n-   Include **flexible volume clauses** to handle demand swings\n\n**C. Build BOM and Technology Flexibility**\n\nAsk suppliers to **qualify multiple NAND die options** across different nodes or vendors. This reduces dependency on a single part number.\n\nDiscuss migration plans:\n\n-   If your module uses 96L or 128L NAND today, when will it shift to 238L?\n-   How will that affect performance, endurance, or firmware?\n\nBudget time and resources for requalification.\n\n**D. Budget for Cost Escalation**\n\nPlan for **5\u201310% annual NAND cost inflation** through 2027. Incorporate those assumptions into your BOM and product pricing models.\n\nThe real risk isn\u2019t higher cost \u2014 it\u2019s being caught off guard by it.\n\n**E. Manage Risk Through Inventory Strategy**\n\nMaintain **safety stock** of key NAND modules and cards. Monitor market signals like NAND price indices andsupplier allocation updates.\n\nWhen the market tightens, execute early **buy-ahead triggers** to lock in supply before price surges.\n\n**5\\. The Road Ahead: What to Expect Through 2027+**\n\n**Tight Supply for Years**\n\nIndustry experts \u2014 including Phison\u2019s CEO \u2014 forecast that **NAND shortages could persist for up to 10 years** as AI demand accelerates. Even if new fabs ramp production, supply won\u2019t outpace growth until late in the decade. [Superssd.com](https://www.superssd.com/news/nand-flash-storage-shortage-could-extend-a-decade-phison-ceo-warns/)\n\n**Rapid Technology Evolution**\n\nExpect transitions to **200+ layer 3D NAND**, increasing capacities but also the complexity of qualification and firmware adaptation.\n\nIndustrial NAND module and card customers should work closely with suppliers to stay aligned on **technology roadmaps**.\n\n**Sustained Price Pressure**\n\nUnlike prior down-cycles, this super-cycle is **structurally driven**, not temporary. With AI and cloud storage consuming unprecedented NAND volumes, expect **elevated pricing through at least 2027**.\n\n**Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risk**\n\nNAND production is concentrated in a few geographies. Political tensions, export controls, or natural disasters could create **unexpected supply disruptions**.\n\nBuilding **supplier diversity** and **regional redundancy** into your sourcing plan is critical.\n\n**The Shift from HDD to SSD Continues**\n\nAs data centers and industrial devices migrate from HDDs to NAND-based SSDs and modules, the global **demand base expands** \u2014 increasing competition for every NAND wafer produced.\n\n**6\\. Your Industrial NAND Procurement Checklist**\n\n**Task**\n\n**Timing**\n\n**Key Actions**\n\nForecast demand\n\nNow\n\nBuild a 2\u20133 year NAND module/card forecast by density and volume\n\nEngage suppliers early\n\nNow\n\nShare forecasts and sourcing strategy\n\nNegotiate supply agreements\n\n3\u20136 months\n\nLock in multi-year contracts and allocation\n\nReview BOM flexibility\n\n3\u20139 months\n\nQualify alternate NAND die and plan transitions\n\nSecure buffer inventory\n\nASAP\n\nHold key stock for risk mitigation\n\nBudget for cost inflation\n\nAnnual\n\nPlan 5\u201310% NAND cost increases\n\nMonitor the market\n\nOngoing\n\nTrack price indices and allocation announcements\n\nManage lifecycle & EOL\n\nOngoing\n\nPlan for NAND node transitions and last-time buys\n\n**7\\. Conclusion: Forecast Early or Fall Behind**\n\nThe **NAND market cycle** is changing \u2014 and industrial customers who continue buying opportunistically will be at risk.\n\nPrices are climbing. Lead-times are lengthening. Allocations are tightening. And with AI and data center demand showing no signs of slowing, these trends will continue through 2027 and likely beyond.\n\nThe path forward is clear:\n\n-   **Forecast NAND demand 24\u201336 months ahead**\n-   **Secure supply through long-term contracts**\n-   **Stay flexible** on NAND technology and BOMs\n-   **Budget for volatility**, not stability\n\nIn a world where NAND flash has become the heartbeat of modern data systems, **proactive planning is your competitive edge**.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for the shortage to hit \u2014 by then, the best supply and pricing will already be gone.\n\n**Plan now. Buy early. Secure your future.**\n\n[Contact Delkin today](https://www.delkin.com/contact/)!\n\n[Delkin Blog](https://www.delkin.com/blog/)[NAND](https://www.delkin.com/nand/)\n\n## Contact Delkin\n\nWe\u2019d Love to Hear From You\u00a0Have questions on\u00a0product configuration samples for compatibility and qualification testing?\n\n[Contact](https://www.delkin.com/contact)\n\n## Connect with Delkin\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/delkin-devices/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DelkinInd)\n\n## Quick Links\n\nMenu\n\n## Resources\n\nMenu\n\n## Our Facility\n\n**Location**\n\n13350 Kirkham Way  \nPoway, CA 92064\n\n[view on map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/13350+Kirkham+Way,+Poway,+CA+92064/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x80dbfba37cabcea1:0xbf39a71ca304569e?sa=X&ei=Z5MZVcfJC8e0ggSSvoGIAg&ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA)\n\n**Phone Numbers**\n\n800.637.8087  \n858.391.1234\n\n[ISO 9001:2015 Certification](https://www.delkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/0153952_ENG_DELKIN-DEVICES.pdf)\n\n## Delkin Blog\n\n[!](https://www.delkin.com/nand/industrial-nand-supply-chain-resilience/)\n\n[Delkin Blog](https://www.delkin.com/blog/)[Locked BOM](https://www.delkin.com/locked-bom/)[NAND](https://www.delkin.com/nand/)[Supply Chain](https://www.delkin.com/supply-chain/) [January 16, 2026](https://www.delkin.com/2026/01/ \"Title Text: \")\n\n##### [Building a Resilient Flash Storage Supply Chain: Lessons from Recent Disruptions](https://www.delkin.com/nand/industrial-nand-supply-chain-resilience/)\n\nThe flash storage market is undergoing one of its most significant disrupt\n\n[Read More](https://www.delkin.com/nand/industrial-nand-supply-chain-resilience/)\n\n[!](https://www.delkin.com/blog/industrial-grade-storage-mission-critical-embedded-systems/)\n\n[Applications](https://www.delkin.com/delkin-applications/)[Delkin Blog](https://www.delkin.com/blog/)[Industrial SD](https://www.delkin.com/industrial-sd/)[Industrial SSD](https://www.delkin.com/industrial-ssd/)[Industrial USB](https://www.delkin.com/industrial-usb/) [December 16, 2025](https://www.delkin.com/2025/12/ \"Title Text: \")\n\n##### [Industrial-Grade Storage for Mission-Critical Embedded Systems: How Delkin Powers Today\u2019s Most Demanding Applications](https://www.delkin.com/blog/industrial-grade-storage-mission-critical-embedded-systems/)\n\nAs embedded systems become more advanced and interconne\n\n[Read More](https://www.delkin.com/blog/industrial-grade-storage-mission-critical-embedded-systems/)\n\n[!](https://www.delkin.com/blog/industrial-flash-storage-medical-hardware/)\n\n[Applications](https://www.delkin.com/delkin-applications/)[Delkin Blog](https://www.delkin.com/blog/)[Industrial SD](https://www.delkin.com/industrial-sd/)[Industrial SSD](https://www.delkin.com/industrial-ssd/)[Life Cycle Management](https://www.delkin.com/life-cycle-management/)[Locked BOM](https://www.delkin.com/locked-bom/) [December 4, 2025](https://www.delkin.com/2025/12/ \"Title Text: \")\n\n##### [Industrial Flash Storage for Medical Hardware: Compliance, Imaging & Diagnostics](https://www.delkin.com/blog/industrial-flash-storage-medical-hardware/)\n\nIn today\u2019s healthcare environment, system performance and regulatory c\n\n[Read More](https://www.delkin.com/blog/industrial-flash-storage-medical-hardware/)\n\n[!](https://www.delkin.com/nand/industrial-nand-supply-chain-resilience/)\n\n[January 16, 2026](https://www.delkin.com/2026/01/)\n\n##### [Building a Resilient Flash Storage Supply Chain: Lessons from Recent Disruptions](https://www.delkin.com/nand/industrial-nand-supply-chain-resilience/)\n\nThe flash storage market is undergoing one of its most significant disruptions in recent memory.
