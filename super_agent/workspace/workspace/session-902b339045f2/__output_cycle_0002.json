Status**: Sold out through 2026, tight through 2027\n✓ **Technology**: HBM4 dominant (70%+ of bits), HBM4E emerging\n✓ **Market Leaders**: SK Hynix (60-70%), Samsung (20-30%), Micron (15-20%)\n✓ **Primary Driver**: AI data center infrastructure (servers >60% of demand)\n✓ **Key Platform**: NVIDIA Blackwell/Rubin GPUs\n✓ **Pricing**: Premium pricing sustained, 50%+ gross margins\n✓ **Geography**: >80% production in South Korea, U.S. domestic capacity starting mid-2027\n✓ **Bottlenecks**: TSV yield (16-Hi), CoWoS packaging, wafer thickness\n✓ **Emerging Segment**: Automotive (34% CAGR, Level 3/4 autonomy)\n✓ **Risks**: Demand moderation, capacity overshooting, geopolitical tensions\n\n**Bottom Line**: The HBM market in 2027 will be characterized by massive scale (~$90B), continued supply constraints, technology transition to HBM4, and sustained pricing power for the three-supplier oligopoly. Memory has become the critical bottleneck for AI advancement, transforming from a commodity to a strategic constraint. The supercycle is expected to run through 2027-2028, with supply finally catching up to demand potentially in 2028-2029.\n\n---\n\n## Data Sources & Verification\n\n**This report is based on web research conducted January 27, 2026, including:**\n\n### Primary Sources (Company Communications):\n- Micron Technology Q1 FY2026 Earnings Call (December 17, 2025)\n- SK Hynix Press Releases and Investor Communications (2025-2026)\n- Samsung Electronics Investor Updates (2025-2026)\n- NVIDIA GPU Platform Announcements\n\n### Financial Analyst Research:\n- JPMorgan Research (September 2025 - HBM market projections)\n- Bank of America Securities (January 2026 - HBM market forecast)\n- UBS (2025-2026 - Market share projections)\n- Bloomberg Intelligence (January 2025 - Long-term market sizing)\n\n### Market Research Firms:\n- Mordor Intelligence (January 2026 - High Bandwidth Memory Market Report)\n- TrendForce (2025-2026 - Memory market analysis)\n- Counterpoint Research (Q3 2025 - Market share data)\n\n### Industry Publications:\n- Reuters (Company news and market developments)\n- Tom's Hardware (Technology specifications and roadmaps)\n- Next Platform (Data center infrastructure analysis)\n- Blocks and Files (Storage and memory market coverage)\n- Digitimes (Supply chain and manufacturing updates)\n\n### Trade Organizations:\n- JEDEC (HBM4 standard publication, April 2025)\n- Korea Semiconductor Industry Association (Industry expert commentary)\n- SEMI (Equipment spending forecasts)\n\n### Government Sources:\n- U.S. Department of Commerce (CHIPS Act funding announcements)\n- NIST (Micron investment details)\n\n**Methodology Note**: Where sources provided conflicting data (particularly market share), multiple sources were consulted and ranges provided.
