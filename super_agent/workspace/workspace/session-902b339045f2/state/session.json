HBM's unit sales price is several times higher than that of conventional DRAM and about five times that of DDR5. This pricing, combined with product iterations in AI chip technology that increase single-device HBM capacity, is expected to dramatically raise HBM\u2019s share in both the capacity and market value of the DRAM market from 2023 to 2025. Specifically, HBM\u2019s share of total DRAM bit capacity is estimated to rise from 2% in 2023 to 5% in 2024 and surpass 10% by 2025. In terms of market value, HBM is projected to account for more than 20% of the total DRAM market value starting in 2024, potentially exceeding 30% by 2025.\n\n!\n\n**2024 sees HBM demand growth rate near 200%, set to double in 2025**\n\nWu also pointed out that negotiations for 2025 HBM pricing have already commenced in 2Q24. However, due to the limited overall capacity of DRAM, suppliers have preliminarily increased prices by 5\u201310% to manage capacity constraints, affecting HBM2e, HBM3, and HBM3e. This early negotiation phase is attributed to three main factors: Firstly, HBM buyers maintain high confidence in AI demand prospects and are willing to accept continued price increases.\n\nSecondly, the yield rates for HBM3e's TSV currently range only from 40% to 60%, with room for improvement. Moreover, not all major suppliers have passed customer qualifications for HBM3e, leading buyers to accept higher prices to secure stable and quality supplies. Thirdly, future per Gb pricing may vary depending on DRAM suppliers' reliability and supply capabilities, which could create disparities in ASP and, consequently, impact profitability.\u00a0\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, from the perspective of major AI solution providers, there will be a significant shift in HBM specification requirements toward HBM3e, with an increase in 12Hi stack products anticipated. This shift is expected to drive up the capacity of HBM per chip. According to TrendForce predictions, the annual growth rate of HBM demand will approach 200% in 2024 and is expected to double in 2025.\n\n!\n\n_For more information on reports and market data from TrendForce\u2019s Department of Semiconductor Research, please click\u00a0[here](http://www.trendforce.com/research/dram), or email the Sales Department at\u00a0[SR\\_MI@trendforce.com](mailto:SR_MI@trendforce.com)_\n\n_For additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit\u00a0[https://www.trendforce.com/news/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/)_\n\n---\n\n[Previous Article  **DRAM Contract Prices for Q2 Adjusted to a 13\u201318% Increase; NAND Flash around 15\u201320%, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240507-12128.html)[Next Article  **AI Demand Drives Rapid Growth in QLC Enterprise SSD Shipments for 2024, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240423-12122.html)\n\n**Subject**\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news)\n\n-   [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/subscribe.html)\n-   [Attribution Guide](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/attribution.html)\n-   [RSS Subscription](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/rss.html)\n\n[In-Depth Analyses](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/analysis)\n\n[Infographics](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/chart)\n\n[Videos](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/video)\n\n---\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n!\n\n[##### AI Architecture Evolution Set to Drive Memory Market Revenue to a New Peak in 2027, with Annual Growth Exceeding 50%, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260122-12893.html)\n\n2026.01.22\n\n!\n\n[##### Global AI Server Shipments Forecast to Grow Over 28% YoY in 2026, with a Rising Share of ASIC-Based Systems, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260120-12887.html)\n\n2026.01.20\n\n!\n\n[##### Micron\u2019s Acquisition of PSMC\u2019s Tongluo Fab Could Lift Global DRAM Supply Outlook in 2027, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260119-12883.html)\n\n2026.01.19\n\n---\n\n**Related Reports**\n\n[##### WW SSD Street Price - Jan. 16, 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131217OO)\n\n2026.01.16\n\n[##### DRAM Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220HJ)\n\n2026.01.15\n\n[##### NAND Flash Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220RX)\n\n2026.01.14\n\n### Get in touch with us\n\n---\n\nYour Email \n\nMessage\n\nSend Cancel"

According to a recent report by JPMorgan, the market for memory chips is set for multi-year expansion, with advanced technologies like High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) driving the majority of growth ([Investing.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2FInvesting%2Ecom&urlhash=EwyZ&trk=public_post-text)). Memory Market Outlook JPMorgan estimates that the total addressable market (TAM) for memory could reach nearly $300 billion by 2027, representing a significant increase compared to current levels. This growth will largely be supported by next-generation HBM4E technology, which is designed to meet the soaring performance requirements of AI models and data-intensive applications. DRAM Pricing Cycle One of the standout projections from the report is the expectation of a four-year pricing upcycle in DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory), spanning from 2024 to 2027. Analysts noted that DRAM prices are likely to grow consistently in the next two years, marking an unprecedented period of stability and strength in what has traditionally been a volatile market. By 2027, HBM alone is expected to contribute 43% of the total DRAM market value, cushioning the industry against sharp pricing swings. HBM at the Core of Growth High-Bandwidth Memory remains the centerpiece of the forecast. JPMorgan projects the HBM market will accelerate in 2027 to reach about $90 billion, supported by strong demand and tight supply conditions. SK Hynix is expected to maintain leadership in HBM4 production, while Samsung Electronics and Micron Technology will compete for the remaining share. NAND Recovery The report also points to a rebound in the NAND flash market, which powers smartphones, SSDs, and other storage devices. After years of underinvestment and hard-disk drive shortages, NAND prices are forecast to rise, with average selling prices projected to climb about 7% in 2026. Capital Spending Trends To support this growth, memory manufacturers are expected to boost capital expenditure (capex) by 7\u201312% in 2026\u201327, particularly in DRAM production, where the economics of HBM remain highly favorable. Investment Perspective While near-term valuations in the sector may appear stretched, JPMorgan maintains a positive outlook on leading memory makers. The firm reiterated its preference for SK Hynix, Samsung Electronics, and Micron, all of which are well-positioned to benefit from this structural upcycle. --- Reference: [Investing.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2FInvesting%2Ecom&urlhash=EwyZ&trk=public_post-text), JPMorgan: Memory-Hungry Trend to Drive $300B Market by 2027, SK Hynix Seen Leading HBM4, September 2025.\n\n [! 2](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ffalaknazkhan_global-memory-market-enters-multi-year-growth-activity-7378238628788994049-dHPO&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ffalaknazkhan_global-memory-market-enters-multi-year-growth-activity-7378238628788994049-dHPO&trk=public_post_like-cta) [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ffalaknazkhan_global-memory-market-enters-multi-year-growth-activity-7378238628788994049-dHPO&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\nShare\n\n-   Copy\n-   LinkedIn\n-   Facebook\n-   X\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Ffalaknazkhan_global-memory-market-enters-multi-year-growth-activity-7378238628788994049-dHPO&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n## More Relevant Posts\n\n-   \n    \n    [![View profile for Nick Florous, Ph.D.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQEmMdYmYZKEbg/profile-displayphoto-scale_400_400/B4DZvqGnl8G8Ag-/0/1769159163931?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=khMAmr1hgricC27oVl0UOfsWApu4QAoKF7I1nZ9CEZw)](https://de.linkedin.com/in/nick-florous-ph-d-2821a84?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n    \n    [Nick Florous, Ph.D.](https://de.linkedin.com/in/nick-florous-ph-d-2821a84?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n    \n    3mo\n    \n    -   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fnick-florous-ph-d-2821a84_semiconductors-dram-ddr4-activity-7381609779611250689-uO4C&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n    \n    \ud83d\udca5 DRAM Market Enters \u201cPrice Blackout\u201d Phase: Elasticity Tested Across Sectors as Supply Tightens \ud83d\udcbe According to\u00a0recent reports,\u00a0Samsung, SK hynix, and Micron\u00a0have\u00a0suspended new enterprise quotations for roughly a week, signaling a deliberate pause to recalibrate market expectations amid intensifying shortages. \ud83d\udcc8\u00a0Market developments: DDR4 contract prices\u00a0are projected to rise\u00a030\u201350 % in Q4 2025, with the rally expected to continue well into\u00a0Q1 2026. A 8Gb DDR4 component is expected to reach or even surpass the $8 level by end of Q4 '25..... Quote validity\u00a0has narrowed from quarterly to bi-weekly, reflecting extreme market volatility. Backend packaging bottlenecks\u00a0have widened the\u00a0DDR4 supply gap to 10\u201315 %. Legacy DRAM and NOR Flash\u00a0now face\u00a0structural shortages\u00a0as wafer capacity continues to migrate toward\u00a0HBM and AI-centric nodes. Module houses, including\u00a0ADATA and Team Group, have followed suit by halting quotations \u2014 the first such synchronized action since 2017. \ud83d\udca1\u00a0Price Elasticity and Demand Impact by Sector: The ongoing rally is beginning to test the\u00a0price elasticity of demand across key industries: \ud83e\udde0\u00a0AI, data center, and hyperscale computing\u00a0remain\u00a0price inelastic, as memory costs represent a small fraction of total compute budgets. These buyers will absorb price increases to maintain model training and inference capacity. \ud83d\ude97\u00a0Automotive platforms, particularly those using\u00a0LPDDR4/LPDDR4X, show\u00a0moderate elasticity. With prices expected to follow DDR4\u2019s trajectory upward by\u00a030\u201340 %, several Tier-1 and OEM programs may\u00a0delay or rephase platform releases into 2H 2026, especially for infotainment and ADAS-edge systems. \u2699\ufe0f\u00a0Industrial, IoT, and consumer electronics, heavily dependent on\u00a0DDR3 and DDR4, show\u00a0high elasticity. Rising component costs may cause\u00a0BOM adjustments, redesigns, or push-outs of cost-sensitive products, especially in mid-range control and smart-home applications. Strategic Outlook: If current pricing momentum persists, we can expect a\u00a0re-sequencing of project timelines\u00a0rather than an absolute drop in consumption. Demand will gradually shift toward\u00a0performance-critical applications, while cost-driven verticals delay procurement. Meanwhile,\u00a0NOR Flash and NAND Flash\u00a0are not immune:\u00a0NOR prices are up 5\u201310 %, and\u00a0SanDisk\u2019s discussions with PSMC\u00a0point to tightening across the broader non-volatile memory spectrum.

The rise of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) means more AI accelerators, GPUs, and high-speed memory tightly coupled inside SoCs. Server & Network Logic\u00a0is dominated by hyperscalers building\u00a0in-house ASICs and AI accelerators\u00a0to reduce costs and optimize workloads. This trend challenges traditional CPU/GPU dominance. Edge SoCs with NPUs\u00a0in PCs, smartphones, and appliances are becoming standard as\u00a0on-device AI\u00a0(voice assistants, real-time translations, AR/VR) demands low-latency and high efficiency. \ud83d\udd39\u00a0Memory \u2013 The Fuel for Compute HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)\u00a0is the backbone of AI data centers, expected to account for\u00a0~50% of data center chip value by 2030\u00a0as GPUs and accelerators multiply. LPDDR (Low-Power DRAM)\u00a0is the enabler of mobile AI, with\u00a0LPDDR6 in 2026\u00a0targeting ~50% lower power consumption than LPDDR5 \u2013 critical for AI smartphones and PCs. Automotive memory\u00a0is rising sharply: EVs and autonomous cars need\u00a0robust DRAM, Flash, and persistent memory\u00a0for safety, infotainment, and ADAS. \ud83c\udf0d\u00a0Geopolitics & Country Focus United States\u00a0\u2192 Strength in chip design (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) and hyperscale AI data centers. The CHIPS Act is fueling\u00a0domestic fabs and AI-accelerator ecosystems, aiming for technology sovereignty. China\u00a0\u2192 Largest EV and smartphone market, aggressively localizing SoC and memory production (CXMT, SMIC, YMTC). Export restrictions on advanced AI GPUs are forcing investment into\u00a0domestic accelerators and DRAM/NAND. Europe\u00a0\u2192 Focused on\u00a0automotive semiconductors\u00a0(Infineon, STMicro) and long-term industrial resilience. EU Chips Act targets reducing dependency on Asian fabs while securing supply for EV/SDV transitions. South Korea & Taiwan\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Memory powerhouses (Samsung, SK hynix, Micron Taiwan fabs)\u00a0and\u00a0logic leaders (TSMC)\u00a0remain indispensable in AI and automotive supply chains. Japan & Southeast Asia\u00a0\u2192 Critical in\u00a0materials, equipment, and packaging. Japan dominates photoresists and specialty chemicals, while Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore are\u00a0rising in OSAT and advanced packaging hubs. India \u2013 The Emerging Hub Design strength: India already hosts a massive base of semiconductor engineers (over 20% of the global chip design workforce), working in R&D and verification for global players such as Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, etc \u2696\ufe0f\u00a0Strategic Implications Supply resilience\u00a0will define winners: balancing U.S./EU subsidies, Asian fab capacity, and China\u2019s domestic push. Energy & efficiency\u00a0will dominate design: zonal SoCs, HBM for AI, and LPDDR for edge. Logic-memory co-optimization\u00a0is no longer optional \u2013 Key to unlock sustainable performance.

The news that SK Hynix is reportedly planning to nearly double its DRAM capacity by 2H26 \u2014 targeting ~600,000 wafers/month to match Samsung \u2014 is a seismic event for the semiconductor supply chain. This is not just capacity expansion; it is a profound strategic pivot driven almost entirely by the insatiable demand for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), fueled by mega-projects like OpenAI's Stargate. The Strategic Implications for the Ecosystem: \ud83d\udca1 HBM Dominance & DRAM Prioritisation: With SK Hynix potentially dedicating 40% of its DRAM output to HBM by 2027 (up from 30% this year), the message is clear: the future is in high-margin, high-value speciality memory. Sigma Insight: Companies in the AI, HPC, and server space must continue to secure long-term HBM contracts, as capacity will remain tight and premiums will be in demand for the next 24 months, even with this massive investment. The market is officially bifurcated. \ud83d\udca1 NAND Pullback & Market Shift: SK Hynix is reportedly keeping NAND investment muted, pivoting production away from commoditised mobile NAND (low-margin, high competition from Chinese rivals) towards enterprise SSDs (eSSDs) and high-capacity QLC NAND.

As data access volumes continue to grow, AI systems depend more on high-bandwidth, high-capacity, low-latency DRAM to handle large-scale model parameters, long-sequence inference, and multi-task parallel processing. Additionally, NAND Flash has become essential for fast data transfer, making memory a key component in AI infrastructure and a strategic focus for CSPs.\n\nMemory prices have continuously increased due to limited capacity and rising demand for allocations, pushing industry revenue to new record levels. TrendForce projects the memory market to be worth $551.6 billion in 2026 and to surge to a peak of $842.7 billion in 2027, reflecting a 53% year-on-year (YoY) growth.\n\nIn early 2025, the DRAM segment was affected by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened end-market sentiment and especially hindered the recovery of consumer applications. However, as market clarity improved in the latter half of the year, North American CSPs greatly raised their capital expenditures. The rapid deployment of AI servers and substantial increases in memory procurement sparked a new rise in prices.\n\n[Connect, collaborate, and innovate in the heart of ASEAN's Power industry.](http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=7017677201&iu=/122049170/TEXT_AD)\n\n!\n\nDriven by surging data-access requirements, DRAM demand has grown at a disproportionately rapid pace. TrendForce predicts that in 2025, the DRAM market will generate $165.7 billion\u2014reflecting a 73% annual increase\u2014and significantly surpass NAND Flash revenue of $69.7 billion for the same year. This gap has led suppliers to focus more on expanding DRAM capacity in their production strategies.\n\nFurthermore, AI workloads have evolved from initial large-model training to systems that combine inference, memory, and decision-making. This development has led to a rapid increase in the need for greater memory capacity, bandwidth, and access efficiency. Consequently, the current upward trend in DRAM prices has significantly surpassed historical levels.\n\nHistorically, peak quarterly price hikes were around 35%, but last year\u2019s fourth quarter saw DRAM prices jump by 53\u201358% due to strong DDR5 demand. Even with already high prices, CSP memory demand stays strong, further driving prices up. TrendForce predicts price increases of over 60% in the first quarter, with some categories nearly doubling. As bullish momentum is expected to continue for the next three quarters, DRAM market revenue could reach $404.3 billion, surging 144% YoY.\n\nReviewing revenue trends in the NAND Flash segment, Nvidia stated at CES 2026 that AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack. As generative AI progresses towards agent-based systems capable of long-term reasoning, AI agents need frequent access to extensive vector databases to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These tasks involve large data sets and highly random access patterns, which greatly increase the need for high-IOPS enterprise SSDs.\n\nThis change is anticipated to boost NAND Flash prices further, with TrendForce predicting a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) rise of 55\u201360% in the first quarter, and a sustained upward trend through the rest of the year. The NAND Flash market revenue in 2026 is expected to jump by 112% YoY to $147.3 billion.\n\nAcross the wider memory market, supply tightness shows no signs of easing, keeping pricing power with suppliers.

The AI memory supercycle has moved from analyst forecast to operational reality, creating a supply-demand imbalance so severe that gaming GPU production faces 40% cuts[2](#fn:2) while memory manufacturers report record margins exceeding 50%.[3](#fn:3)\n\nThis constraint represents more than a temporary supply disruption. The memory industry has undergone a structural reset, transitioning from decades of boom-and-bust cyclicality to sustained demand premiums driven by generative AI's insatiable appetite for bandwidth. Understanding how HBM became AI's critical bottleneck requires examining the technical requirements driving demand, the oligopolistic market structure controlling supply, and the infrastructure implications that will shape data center economics for years.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n-   HBM capacity sold out through 2026 across all major suppliers (SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung)\n-   Market TAM projected to reach $100B by 2028, up from $35B in 2025 (~40% CAGR)\n-   SK Hynix dominates with 62% market share; NVIDIA accounts for ~90% of their HBM supply\n-   NVIDIA cutting gaming GPU production 30-40% in H1 2026 due to GDDR7 constraints\n-   HBM4 entering production in 2026, with 16-Hi stacks targeting Q4 2026\n-   Memory industry consolidation creates pricing power unprecedented in semiconductor history\n\n## The Technical Imperative: Why AI Needs HBM\n\nThe relationship between AI model performance and memory bandwidth represents one of the most consequential technical constraints in computing. Large language models and generative AI systems face a fundamental bottleneck: moving parameters between memory and compute cores consumes more time and energy than the actual mathematical operations.[4](#fn:4)\n\nStandard GDDR memory, designed for gaming workloads with high throughput but acceptable latency, cannot satisfy AI's bandwidth requirements. High-bandwidth memory addresses this limitation through vertical stacking, placing multiple DRAM dies on top of each other with through-silicon vias (TSVs) providing thousands of simultaneous data connections.[5](#fn:5)\n\nThe numbers tell the story. NVIDIA's H100 GPU uses 80GB of HBM3 with 3.35 TB/s bandwidth.[6](#fn:6) The H200 increased capacity to 141GB of HBM3e at 4.8 TB/s.[7](#fn:7) The Blackwell B200 features 192GB of HBM3e achieving 8.0 TB/s, more than double H100's bandwidth.[8](#fn:8) The upcoming Rubin R100 will pack 288GB of HBM4 with estimated bandwidth between 13-15 TB/s.[9](#fn:9)\n\nThis progression reflects AI's memory requirements scaling faster than Moore's Law. A quick rule of thumb for serving large language models in 16-bit precision: approximately 2GB of GPU memory per 1 billion parameters.[10](#fn:10) Llama 3's 70B variant requires more than a single 80GB A100.[11](#fn:11) Models approaching 1 trillion parameters demand multi-GPU configurations where HBM capacity becomes the binding constraint.\n\nThe KV cache presents an additional memory challenge. During inference, transformers store key-value pairs from previous tokens to avoid recomputation. This cache grows linearly with context length, consuming approximately 0.5MB per token in a 7B model.[12](#fn:12) An \"LLM that needs 60GB for weights\" often cannot run reliably on an 80GB GPU with long prompts because runtime memory growth, not weights, becomes the limiting factor.[13](#fn:13)\n\n## The Oligopoly Advantage: Three Players Control 95%\n\nUnderstanding the memory supercycle requires examining the market structure that evolved over decades of consolidation. Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron together control approximately 95% of global DRAM production.[14](#fn:14) This concentration resulted from brutal competitive dynamics that eliminated weaker players.\n\nIn 2009, ten companies controlled the DRAM market: Micron, Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida, and Nanya.[15](#fn:15) The 2011 downcycle triggered final consolidation. SK Telecom acquired Hynix for $3 billion in 2012.[16](#fn:16) Elpida, Japan's last DRAM manufacturer, went bankrupt and was purchased by Micron in 2013.[17](#fn:17) Within five years, the industry consolidated from ten competitors to three.\n\nThis oligopolistic structure manifests in coordinated market behavior. In recent weeks, SK Hynix, Samsung, and Micron made nearly simultaneous announcements halting new DDR4 orders.[18](#fn:18) Industry analyst Moore Morris characterized this as a \"stunning break from decades of industry practice,\" noting that \"for them to act in such a coordinated fashion is unprecedented.\"[19](#fn:19) The DRAM oligopoly effectively controlled supply while demand remained robust, demonstrating collective market power that shows \"the memory industry is no longer playing by the old rules.\"[20](#fn:20)\n\nThe HBM segment concentrates this power further. SK Hynix dominates with 62% market share as of Q2 2025, Micron follows with 21%, and Samsung trails with 17%.[21](#fn:21) SK Hynix's position stems from its early HBM bet and its relationship as NVIDIA's primary supplier. Currently, approximately 90% of NVIDIA's HBM comes from SK Hynix.[22](#fn:22)\n\n| Supplier | HBM Market Share (Q2 2025) | Key Customer | 2026 Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SK Hynix | 62% | NVIDIA (90%) | Sold out |\n| Micron | 21% | NVIDIA (second source) | Sold out |\n| Samsung | 17% | AMD, Google | Qualification issues |\n\nSamsung's third-place position represents a remarkable fall for a company that long dominated memory. SK Hynix surpassed Samsung in overall DRAM market share in Q1 2025, the first time Samsung lost its leadership position.[23](#fn:23) Samsung's HBM3E parts faced qualification delays with major customers, allowing competitors to capture premium AI demand while Samsung served lower-margin segments.[24](#fn:24)\n\n## The $100 Billion Inflection\n\nMicron projects the HBM total addressable market will reach approximately $100 billion by 2028, up from roughly $35 billion in 2025.[25](#fn:25) This represents a compound annual growth rate near 40%.[26](#fn:26) The $100 billion milestone arrives two years earlier than previously forecast; analysts originally projected reaching this level by 2030.[27](#fn:27)\n\nSeveral factors drive this acceleration. First, generative AI deployment continues outpacing expectations. Every major hyperscaler races to deploy inference capacity for their AI products while training next-generation models requires ever-larger GPU clusters.[28](#fn:28) Second, HBM capacity per GPU continues increasing. The progression from H100's 80GB to Rubin's 288GB means each accelerator consumes 3.6 times more HBM.[29](#fn:29) Third, system-level memory requirements compound individual GPU needs. NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GB300 expects to feature up to 288GB of HBM3e, while Rubin Ultra variants target 512GB, with the full NVL576 system potentially requiring 1TB per GPU module.[30](#fn:30)\n\nThe broader data center semiconductor market provides context. In 2024, total semiconductor TAM for data centers reached $209 billion across compute, memory, networking, and power.[31](#fn:31) Yole Group projects this will grow to nearly $500 billion by 2030.[32](#fn:32) Memory alone grew 78% in 2024 to $170 billion, followed by another double-digit increase to $200 billion in 2025.[33](#fn:33)\n\nMicron's financial results demonstrate how these dynamics translate to corporate performance. The company reported fiscal Q1 2026 revenue of $13.64 billion, a 57% year-over-year increase.[34](#fn:34) Gross margins climbed above 50%, doubling from approximately 22% in fiscal year 2024.[35](#fn:35) This margin expansion reflects not cyclical conditions but structural transformation in the company's product mix toward high-margin data center products.[36](#fn:36)\n\n## The HBM4 Race: 16-Hi Stacks and Beyond\n\nCompetition among memory suppliers now centers on HBM4, the next-generation technology entering production in 2026. SK Hynix completed the world's first HBM4 development and has finished mass production preparations.[37](#fn:37) Both SK Hynix and Samsung delivered paid final HBM4 samples to NVIDIA, signaling entry into commercially driven supply negotiations.[38](#fn:38)\n\nHBM4 offers substantial improvements over HBM3e. Data transfer speeds reach 11 gigabits per second with total bandwidth exceeding 2.8 terabytes per second.[39](#fn:39) The standard incorporates a logic base die manufactured using advanced process nodes, with SK Hynix partnering with TSMC's 12nm process.[40](#fn:40) This collaboration proved attractive to NVIDIA and contributed to SK Hynix securing primary supplier status for Blackwell Ultra and Rubin platforms.[41](#fn:41)\n\nThe more challenging technical frontier involves 16-layer HBM stacks. NVIDIA reportedly requested 16-Hi HBM delivery by Q4 2026, triggering development sprints at all three suppliers.[42](#fn:42) Ahn Ki-hyun, executive vice president of the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association, noted that \"the transition from 12 to 16 layers is technically much harder than from 8 to 12.\"[43](#fn:43)\n\nThe difficulty stems from wafer thickness constraints. Existing 12-Hi HBM uses wafers approximately 50 micrometers thick. Stacking 16 layers requires reducing thickness to around 30 micrometers while maintaining structural integrity and thermal performance.[44](#fn:44) Industry observers describe the technical challenges as \"formidable.\"[45](#fn:45)\n\n| Generation | Layers | Capacity | Bandwidth | Production |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| HBM3 | 8-Hi | 80GB | 3.35 TB/s | 2023 |\n| HBM3e | 12-Hi | 141-192GB | 4.8-8.0 TB/s | 2024-2025 |\n| HBM4 | 12-Hi | 288GB | 11+ TB/s | H2 2026 |\n| HBM4E | 16-Hi | 512GB+ | 15+ TB/s | Late 2026-2027 |\n\nSamsung and SK Hynix pushed HBM4 production schedules to February 2026, accelerating previous timelines.[46](#fn:46) Micron expects to enter HBM4 mass production in 2026, followed by HBM4E in 2027-2028.[47](#fn:47) The 16-Hi variants, likely branded HBM4E, may arrive as early as late 2026 depending on yield improvements.[48](#fn:48)\n\n## Gaming's Collateral Damage\n\nThe memory supercycle's most visible consumer impact: NVIDIA plans to slash RTX 50-series GPU production by 30-40% in H1 2026 due to GDDR7 shortages.[49](#fn:49) Memory suppliers prioritize AI data center allocations over consumer GPUs, creating cascading effects throughout the graphics card market.[50](#fn:50)\n\nThe supply dynamics differ from HBM but connect through manufacturing capacity allocation. GDDR7 production faces deprioritization in favor of DDR5, driving up graphics memory prices.[51](#fn:51) In 2025 alone, memory prices increased 246%, with continued increases expected through 2026.[52](#fn:52)\n\nSpecific products face the sharpest cuts: the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, both featuring 16GB of GDDR7.[53](#fn:53) Only Samsung produces 3GB GDDR7 modules in quantity, and if NVIDIA already consumes 2GB chips, shifting to higher-density modules reduces total VRAM available for standard Blackwell graphics cards.[54](#fn:54)\n\nThe RTX 50 Super series faces delays or potential cancellation. Original timelines targeted early 2026; current projections suggest Q3 2026 at earliest.[55](#fn:55) The 3GB GDDR7 modules required for Super configurations simply are not available in volume.[56](#fn:56) Memory manufacturers struggle to produce enough standard 2GB GDDR7 chips while simultaneously scaling to 3GB modules.\n\nFor consumers, this translates to higher prices and longer wait times, particularly during late 2026 holiday seasons.[57](#fn:57) Fixed-term memory procurement contracts kept 2025 pricing stable, but 2026 brings renegotiation at elevated spot prices.[58](#fn:58) AMD faces similar constraints with GDDR6 for its Radeon lineup.[59](#fn:59)\n\nThis priority hierarchy reflects economic reality. HBM for data center GPUs commands margins far exceeding consumer graphics memory. When capacity constraints force allocation decisions, suppliers rationally serve higher-margin customers first. Gaming represents collateral damage in AI's resource competition.\n\n## Geopolitics and Domestic Production\n\nThe memory supercycle intersects with broader semiconductor sovereignty concerns. Micron remains the only U.S.-based manufacturer of advanced memory chips, and currently 100% of leading-edge DRAM production occurs overseas, primarily in East Asia.[60](#fn:60)\n\nCHIPS Act funding addresses this concentration. Micron secured up to $6.4 billion in direct federal funding supporting construction of two Idaho fabs and two New York fabs, plus expansion of its Virginia facility.[61](#fn:61) The company announced expanded investments totaling approximately $200 billion across Idaho, New York, and Virginia, projected to create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs.[62](#fn:62)\n\nThe Idaho facilities take priority. Micron redirected approximately $1.2 billion of federal funding from New York to Idaho, reducing Clay, New York's allocation from $4.6 billion to $3.4 billion.[63](#fn:63) First wafer output from the new Boise fab is expected in mid-2027.[64](#fn:64) Following completion, Micron plans to bring advanced HBM packaging capabilities to the United States for the first time.[65](#fn:65)\n\nNew York remains committed despite timeline adjustments. The state provided up to $5.5 billion in Green CHIPS incentives over the project's life.[66](#fn:66) Micron's four planned fabs in Clay will come online sequentially, with Fabs 1 and 2 operational by 2029-2030 and Fabs 3 and 4 by 2035 and 2041.[67](#fn:67)\n\n| Location | Investment | Federal Funding | Timeline |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Boise, Idaho | ~$50B (2 fabs) | ~$4B | Mid-2027 first wafers |\n| Clay, New York | ~$100B (4 fabs) | ~$3.4B | 2029-2041 phased |\n| Manassas, Virginia | Expansion | $275M | Ongoing |\n\nThese investments address long-term supply security but offer limited near-term relief. Facilities opening in 2027-2029 cannot ease 2026 supply constraints. The memory supercycle's immediate phase will be defined by existing capacity at Korean and Asian facilities.\n\n## Infrastructure Implications: Preparing for Memory-Constrained AI\n\nFor data center operators and AI infrastructure providers, the memory supercycle creates planning challenges unlike previous technology constraints. Semiconductor supply disruptions typically resolve within 12-18 months as capacity expands. This situation differs fundamentally because demand growth rates exceed capacity expansion rates.\n\nIntrol's field engineering teams encounter these constraints directly. Deploying HPC-specialized infrastructure across 257 global locations means allocating scarce GPU resources across competing priorities.[68](#fn:68) When HBM capacity sells out years in advance, traditional procurement approaches fail. Strategic relationships with GPU suppliers become essential, and secondary market dynamics increasingly influence deployment timelines.\n\nSeveral strategic responses merit consideration:\n\n**Memory-efficient architectures gain priority.** Quantization reduces model weights from 16-bit to 8-bit or 4-bit precision, halving or quartering memory requirements with acceptable performance trade-offs.[69](#fn:69) Mixture-of-experts architectures reduce compute requirements though not memory footprint, since all experts must remain resident.[70](#fn:70)\n\n**Infrastructure planning horizons extend.** If HBM constraints persist through 2027, procurement cycles must begin 18-24 months before deployment targets. Organizations accustomed to just-in-time IT provisioning face cultural adaptation.\n\n**Alternative architectures warrant evaluation.** AMD's MI300X offers HBM3 capacity competitive with NVIDIA at different price points. Intel's Gaudi accelerators provide inference options outside the NVIDIA ecosystem. While software compatibility favors NVIDIA dominance, supply constraints create openings for alternatives.\n\n**Inference optimization becomes essential.** Runtime memory management, KV cache optimization, and batching strategies determine whether fixed GPU capacity serves one concurrent request or dozens. The gap between naive and optimized inference implementations can exceed 10x in memory efficiency.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n**For AI/ML Teams:** - Plan GPU requirements 18-24 months ahead; spot procurement faces supply constraints through 2026-2027 - Evaluate quantization and memory-efficient architectures to maximize throughput on constrained hardware - Runtime memory optimization (KV cache, batching) determines practical capacity from fixed GPU inventory\n\n**For Infrastructure Leaders:** - HBM supply constraints will persist beyond current planning horizons; build supplier relationships accordingly - Gaming GPU availability will decline through H1 2026; workstation and development system procurement faces spillover effects - CHIPS Act investments provide long-term supply security but offer no near-term relief\n\n**For Executives:** - Memory has become AI's binding constraint, potentially more limiting than GPU compute availability - The three-player oligopoly creates pricing power; budget for sustained premium margins - Geographic concentration in East Asia represents supply chain risk; monitor domestic capacity expansion\n\n## The Constraint That Defines a Generation\n\nThe AI memory supercycle represents a structural shift in how the semiconductor industry allocates resources. For the first time, memory commands pricing power and capacity priority over processors. This inversion reflects AI's fundamental nature as a memory-bandwidth-limited workload.\n\nThe next two years will determine whether supply can catch up to demand or whether memory constraints become a lasting feature of AI infrastructure economics. Current evidence suggests the latter. Even with aggressive capacity expansion, 40% annual demand growth means the industry runs perpetually to stand still.\n\nFor organizations building AI infrastructure, this reality demands adaptation. Procurement timelines must extend. Memory efficiency must improve. Alternative architectures merit consideration. The era of abundant compute waiting for software development has inverted; software optimization now races to make efficient use of scarce hardware.\n\nThe AI memory supercycle will end eventually, as all supply constraints do. But the structural transformation it drives, from boom-bust cyclicality to sustained premium pricing, from compute-first architectures to memory-optimized designs, may prove permanent. Memory has become AI's critical infrastructure, and the industry is only beginning to adapt.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n---\n\n1.

NVIDIA\u2019s H100 combined 80 GB of HBM3, delivering 3.35 TB/s, while the H200 was sampled in early 2025 with 141 GB of HBM3E at 4.8 TB/s.\\[1\\]NVIDIA, \u201cGPU Memory Essentials for AI Performance,\u201d nvidia.com Order backlogs locked in the majority of supplier capacity through 2026, forcing data-center operators to pre-purchase inventory and co-invest in packaging lines.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nData-Center Shift to DDR5 and 2.5-D Packaging\n\nHyperscalers moved workloads from DDR4 to DDR5 to obtain 50% better performance per watt, simultaneously adopting 2.5-D integration that links AI accelerators to stacked memory on silicon interposers. Dependence on a single packaging platform heightened supply-chain risk when substrate shortages delayed GPU launches throughout 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEdge-AI Inference in Automotive ADAS\n\nAutonomous vehicles that reach Level 4 capability process sensor streams above 1 TB/s, pushing the automotive tier toward HBM4 samples qualified under ISO 26262. Memory vendors introduced safety-oriented designs that include built-in ECC and enhanced thermal monitoring to meet functional-safety mandates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHyperscaler Preference for Silicon Interposer Stacks\n\nCustom AI chips from AWS, Google, and Microsoft integrated multiple HBM stacks through TSMC\u2019s CoWoS, achieving interconnect densities above 10,000 connections/mm\u00b2. Vendors reacted to capacity shortages by funding dedicated interposer lines and co-developing chiplet architectures that shrink interposer footprints.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRestraints Impact Analysis\n\n| Restraint | (~) % Impact on CAGR Forecast | Geographic Relevance | Impact Timeline |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TSV yield losses above 12-layer stacks | \\-4.2% | Global, concentrated in advanced fabs | Medium term (2-4 years) |\n| Limited CoWoS/SoIC advanced-packaging capacity | \\-3.8% | Asia-Pacific, affecting global supply | Short term (\u2264 2 years) |\n| Thermal throttling in >1 TB/s bandwidth devices | \\-2.1% | Global, particularly in data centers | Medium term (2-4 years) |\n| Geo-political export controls on AI accelerators | \\-1.9% | China, with spillover effects globally | Long term (\u2265 4 years) |\n| Source: Mordor Intelligence |\n\nTSV Yield Losses Above 12-Layer Stacks\n\nYield fell below 70% on 16-high HBM stacks because thermal cycling induced copper-migration failures within TSVs. Manufacturers pursued thermal through-silicon via designs and novel dielectric materials to stabilize reliability, but commercialization remains two years away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLimited CoWoS/SoIC Advanced-Packaging Capacity\n\nCoWoS lines averaged 95% utilization in 2024; substrate makers struggled to supply T-Glass at sufficient volumes, forcing allocation to top customers and delaying emerging AI accelerator programs. Alternative SoIC flows from Samsung and EMIB from Intel entered early ramp, yet could not offset near-term shortages.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## Segment Analysis\n\nBy Application: Servers Drive Infrastructure Transformation\n\nThe server category led the high bandwidth memory market with a 67.80% revenue share in 2025, reflecting hyperscale operators\u2019 pivot to AI servers that each integrate eight to twelve HBM stacks. Demand accelerated after cloud providers launched foundation-model services that rely on per-GPU bandwidth above 3 TB/s. Energy efficiency targets in 2025 favored stacked DRAM because it delivered superior performance-per-watt over discrete solutions, enabling data-center operators to stay within power envelopes. An enterprise refresh cycle began as companies replaced DDR4-based nodes with HBM-enabled accelerators, extending purchasing commitments into 2027.\n\nThe automotive and transportation segment, while smaller today, recorded the fastest growth with a projected 34.18% CAGR through 2031. Chipmakers collaborated with Tier 1 suppliers to embed functional-safety features that meet ASIL D requirements. Level 3 production programs in Europe and North America entered limited rollout in late 2024, each vehicle using memory bandwidth previously reserved for data-center inference clusters. As over-the-air update strategies matured, vehicle manufacturers began treating cars as edge servers, further sustaining HBM attach rates.\n\n![High Bandwidth Memory Market: Market Share by Application, 2025](https://s3.mordorintelligence.com/high-bandwidth-memory-market/high-bandwidth-memory-market-High-Bandwidth-Memory-Market-Market-Share-by-Application-2025-1767007868361.webp)\n\nImage \u00a9 Mordor Intelligence.

Sampling of HBM3E started in Q1 2024, and first-wave production ran at pin speeds above 9.2 Gb/s. Performance gains reached 1.2 TB/s per stack, reducing the number of stacks needed for the target bandwidth and lowering package thermal density.\n\nHBM3E\u2019s 40.90% forecast CAGR is underpinned by Micron\u2019s 36 GB, 12-high product that entered volume production in mid-2025, targeting accelerators with model sizes up to 520 billion parameters. Looking forward, the HBM4 standard published in April 2025 doubles channels per stack and raises aggregate throughput to 2 TB/s, setting the stage for multi-petaflop AI processors.\n\nBy Memory Capacity: 16 GB Mainstream Yields to 32 GB Expansion\n\nThe 16 GB tier represented 38.20% of the high bandwidth memory market share during 2025, balancing yield and capacity for mainstream LLM training nodes. Suppliers relied on mature 8-high stack configurations that shipped at high yields, supporting aggressive cost targets.\n\nDemand for larger models spurred a swift pivot toward 32 GB and 36 GB offerings, driving a 36.40% CAGR expectation for 32 GB-plus devices to 2031. Micron\u2019s 36 GB, 12-high HBM3E widened capacity without exceeding 12-layer TSV risk thresholds. Upcoming 24-high HBM4E roadmaps target 64 GB per stack, although vendors continued to refine embedded cooling to offset thermal density.\n\n![High Bandwidth Memory Market: Market Share by Memory Capacity, 2025](https://s3.mordorintelligence.com/high-bandwidth-memory-market/high-bandwidth-memory-market-High-Bandwidth-Memory-Market-Market-Share-by-Memory-Capacity-2025-1767007872713.webp)\n\nImage \u00a9 Mordor Intelligence.

Peak utilization rates forced cloud operators to reserve future wafer outputs well into 2026.\n\nCustom AI accelerators showed a 32.00% projected CAGR to 2031 as hyperscalers shifted toward internally designed chips optimized for proprietary workloads. These ASICs often integrate high bandwidth memory directly on-package, eliminating off-chip latency. FPGA-based cards retained a niche position in network function virtualization and low-latency trading, leveraging HBM to sustain throughput without sacrificing reconfigurability.\n\n## Geography Analysis\n\nAsia-Pacific accounted for 41.00% of 2025 revenue, anchored by South Korea, where SK Hynix and Samsung controlled more than 80% of production lines. Government incentives announced in 2024 supported an expanded fabrication cluster scheduled to open in 2027. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC maintained a packaging monopoly for leading-edge CoWoS, tying memory availability to local substrate supply and creating a regional concentration risk.\n\nNorth America\u2019s share grew as Micron secured USD 6.1 billion in CHIPS Act funding to build advanced DRAM fabs in New York and Idaho, with pilot HBM runs expected in early 2026. Hyperscaler capital expenditures continued to drive local demand, although most wafers were still processed in Asia before final module assembly in the United States.\n\nEurope entered the market through automotive demand; German OEMs qualified HBM for Level 3 driver-assist systems shipping in late 2024. The EU\u2019s semiconductor strategy remained R&D-centric, favoring photonic interconnect and neuromorphic research that could unlock future high bandwidth memory market expansion. Middle East and Africa stayed in an early adoption phase, yet sovereign AI datacenter projects initiated in 2025 suggested a coming uptick in regional demand.\n\n![High Bandwidth Memory Market CAGR (%), Growth Rate by Region](https://s3.mordorintelligence.com/high-bandwidth-memory-market/high-bandwidth-memory-market-High-Bandwidth-Memory-Market-CAGR--Growth-Rate-by-Region-2026---2031-1767007877107.webp)\n\nImage \u00a9 Mordor Intelligence. Reuse requires attribution under CC BY 4.0.\n\nGet Analysis on Important Geographic Markets\n\nDownload PDF\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\nThe high bandwidth memorymarket displayed oligopolistic characteristics because SK Hynix, Samsung, and Micron collectively supplied more than 95% of global output. SK Hynix held leadership thanks to early TSV investment and sole-source contracts with NVIDIA for HBM3E. Samsung narrowed the gap after resolving 2024 yield issues and launching a dual-site HBM4 line at Pyeongtaek in mid-2025. Micron accelerated share gains by pairing its 36 GB HBM3E with AMD\u2019s MI350 GPU, providing an attractive alternative for open AI hardware ecosystems.\n\nCompetition shifted from core cell technology toward advanced packaging alliances. SK Hynix and TSMC announced a co-production model that couples N3 logic with HBM4 stacks under a single procurement cycle, locking in customers through 2028.\\[4\\]SK Hynix, \u201cSK Hynix Partners With TSMC to Strengthen HBM Leadership,\u201d skhynix.com Suppliers also targeted differentiated niches such as automotive-qualified HBM variants that incorporate extended temperature ranges and real-time diagnostics. Chinese entrants continued to develop domestic HBM2E and HBM3 capabilities; however, export controls limited equipment access, keeping their offerings one to two generations behind.\n\nThe push toward application-specific memory catalyzed a service-oriented engagement model where vendors tune speed bins, channel counts, and ECC schemes to individual workloads. This customization strategy built switching costs that favored incumbent suppliers and reinforced market concentration through 2030.\n\n## High Bandwidth Memory Industry Leaders\n\n1.

HBM's unit sales price is several times higher than that of conventional DRAM and about five times that of DDR5. This pricing, combined with product iterations in AI chip technology that increase single-device HBM capacity, is expected to dramatically raise HBM\u2019s share in both the capacity and market value of the DRAM market from 2023 to 2025. Specifically, HBM\u2019s share of total DRAM bit capacity is estimated to rise from 2% in 2023 to 5% in 2024 and surpass 10% by 2025. In terms of market value, HBM is projected to account for more than 20% of the total DRAM market value starting in 2024, potentially exceeding 30% by 2025.\n\n!\n\n**2024 sees HBM demand growth rate near 200%, set to double in 2025**\n\nWu also pointed out that negotiations for 2025 HBM pricing have already commenced in 2Q24. However, due to the limited overall capacity of DRAM, suppliers have preliminarily increased prices by 5\u201310% to manage capacity constraints, affecting HBM2e, HBM3, and HBM3e. This early negotiation phase is attributed to three main factors: Firstly, HBM buyers maintain high confidence in AI demand prospects and are willing to accept continued price increases.\n\nSecondly, the yield rates for HBM3e's TSV currently range only from 40% to 60%, with room for improvement. Moreover, not all major suppliers have passed customer qualifications for HBM3e, leading buyers to accept higher prices to secure stable and quality supplies. Thirdly, future per Gb pricing may vary depending on DRAM suppliers' reliability and supply capabilities, which could create disparities in ASP and, consequently, impact profitability.\u00a0\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, from the perspective of major AI solution providers, there will be a significant shift in HBM specification requirements toward HBM3e, with an increase in 12Hi stack products anticipated. This shift is expected to drive up the capacity of HBM per chip. According to TrendForce predictions, the annual growth rate of HBM demand will approach 200% in 2024 and is expected to double in 2025.\n\n!\n\n_For more information on reports and market data from TrendForce\u2019s Department of Semiconductor Research, please click\u00a0[here](http://www.trendforce.com/research/dram), or email the Sales Department at\u00a0[SR\\_MI@trendforce.com](mailto:SR_MI@trendforce.com)_\n\n_For additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit\u00a0[https://www.trendforce.com/news/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/)_\n\n---\n\n[Previous Article  **DRAM Contract Prices for Q2 Adjusted to a 13\u201318% Increase; NAND Flash around 15\u201320%, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240507-12128.html)[Next Article  **AI Demand Drives Rapid Growth in QLC Enterprise SSD Shipments for 2024, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240423-12122.html)\n\n**Subject**\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news)\n\n-   [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/subscribe.html)\n-   [Attribution Guide](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/attribution.html)\n-   [RSS Subscription](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/rss.html)\n\n[In-Depth Analyses](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/analysis)\n\n[Infographics](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/chart)\n\n[Videos](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/video)\n\n---\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n!\n\n[##### AI Architecture Evolution Set to Drive Memory Market Revenue to a New Peak in 2027, with Annual Growth Exceeding 50%, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260122-12893.html)\n\n2026.01.22\n\n!\n\n[##### Global AI Server Shipments Forecast to Grow Over 28% YoY in 2026, with a Rising Share of ASIC-Based Systems, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260120-12887.html)\n\n2026.01.20\n\n!\n\n[##### Micron\u2019s Acquisition of PSMC\u2019s Tongluo Fab Could Lift Global DRAM Supply Outlook in 2027, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260119-12883.html)\n\n2026.01.19\n\n---\n\n**Related Reports**\n\n[##### WW SSD Street Price - Jan. 16, 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131217OO)\n\n2026.01.16\n\n[##### DRAM Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220HJ)\n\n2026.01.15\n\n[##### NAND Flash Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220RX)\n\n2026.01.14\n\n### Get in touch with us\n\n---\n\nYour Email \n\nMessage\n\nSend Cancel"
