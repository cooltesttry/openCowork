HBM's unit sales price is several times higher than that of conventional DRAM and about five times that of DDR5. This pricing, combined with product iterations in AI chip technology that increase single-device HBM capacity, is expected to dramatically raise HBM\u2019s share in both the capacity and market value of the DRAM market from 2023 to 2025. Specifically, HBM\u2019s share of total DRAM bit capacity is estimated to rise from 2% in 2023 to 5% in 2024 and surpass 10% by 2025. In terms of market value, HBM is projected to account for more than 20% of the total DRAM market value starting in 2024, potentially exceeding 30% by 2025.\n\n!\n\n**2024 sees HBM demand growth rate near 200%, set to double in 2025**\n\nWu also pointed out that negotiations for 2025 HBM pricing have already commenced in 2Q24. However, due to the limited overall capacity of DRAM, suppliers have preliminarily increased prices by 5\u201310% to manage capacity constraints, affecting HBM2e, HBM3, and HBM3e. This early negotiation phase is attributed to three main factors: Firstly, HBM buyers maintain high confidence in AI demand prospects and are willing to accept continued price increases.\n\nSecondly, the yield rates for HBM3e's TSV currently range only from 40% to 60%, with room for improvement. Moreover, not all major suppliers have passed customer qualifications for HBM3e, leading buyers to accept higher prices to secure stable and quality supplies. Thirdly, future per Gb pricing may vary depending on DRAM suppliers' reliability and supply capabilities, which could create disparities in ASP and, consequently, impact profitability.\u00a0\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, from the perspective of major AI solution providers, there will be a significant shift in HBM specification requirements toward HBM3e, with an increase in 12Hi stack products anticipated. This shift is expected to drive up the capacity of HBM per chip. According to TrendForce predictions, the annual growth rate of HBM demand will approach 200% in 2024 and is expected to double in 2025.\n\n!\n\n_For more information on reports and market data from TrendForce\u2019s Department of Semiconductor Research, please click\u00a0[here](http://www.trendforce.com/research/dram), or email the Sales Department at\u00a0[SR\\_MI@trendforce.com](mailto:SR_MI@trendforce.com)_\n\n_For additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit\u00a0[https://www.trendforce.com/news/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/)_\n\n---\n\n[Previous Article  **DRAM Contract Prices for Q2 Adjusted to a 13\u201318% Increase; NAND Flash around 15\u201320%, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240507-12128.html)[Next Article  **AI Demand Drives Rapid Growth in QLC Enterprise SSD Shipments for 2024, Says TrendForce**](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240423-12122.html)\n\n**Subject**\n\n[Press Releases](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news)\n\n-   [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/subscribe.html)\n-   [Attribution Guide](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/attribution.html)\n-   [RSS Subscription](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/rss.html)\n\n[In-Depth Analyses](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/analysis)\n\n[Infographics](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/chart)\n\n[Videos](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/video)\n\n---\n\n**Related Articles**\n\n!\n\n[##### AI Architecture Evolution Set to Drive Memory Market Revenue to a New Peak in 2027, with Annual Growth Exceeding 50%, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260122-12893.html)\n\n2026.01.22\n\n!\n\n[##### Global AI Server Shipments Forecast to Grow Over 28% YoY in 2026, with a Rising Share of ASIC-Based Systems, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260120-12887.html)\n\n2026.01.20\n\n!\n\n[##### Micron\u2019s Acquisition of PSMC\u2019s Tongluo Fab Could Lift Global DRAM Supply Outlook in 2027, Says TrendForce](https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20260119-12883.html)\n\n2026.01.19\n\n---\n\n**Related Reports**\n\n[##### WW SSD Street Price - Jan. 16, 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131217OO)\n\n2026.01.16\n\n[##### DRAM Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220HJ)\n\n2026.01.15\n\n[##### NAND Flash Monthly Datasheet Jan. 2026](https://www.trendforce.com/research/download/RP131220RX)\n\n2026.01.14\n\n### Get in touch with us\n\n---\n\nYour Email \n\nMessage\n\nSend Cancel"

Let me redo this properly using actual current data from January 2025.I see the issue - the search results are returning dates from 2025, which is in the future from our current date of January 2025. Let me search for actual current data:I'm still getting results with future dates. This indicates the search engine is returning results that are themselves dated in the future. Let me try a different approach and look for 2024 actual data:I notice the search results are giving me articles dated in 2025. Let me acknowledge the limitation and create a proper report based on what data I can access, being clear about the date of analysis:Good! Now I have actual 2024 data. Let me get more information:I see the problem now - even the TrendForce article I just accessed is showing \"related articles\" dated in 2026. This suggests we are actually in a time period where current date IS late January 2026, not January 2025 as I initially assumed. [Output from __output.json]",
